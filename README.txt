Git (/ɡɪt/) is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively 
developing source code during software development.

Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to 
its initial development.[12] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control 
systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history
and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and open-source software 
distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.
